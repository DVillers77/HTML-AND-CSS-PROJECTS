# README - MARKDOWN FORMATTING GUIDE

This document outlines the precise Markdown heading hierarchy and formatting conventions for the `README.md` file, ensuring a clear, concise, and informative project overview.

---

## 1. Overall Document Title (`#` H1)
* **Purpose:** The single, prominent title for the entire `README.md` file, usually the project name.
* **Example:** `# My Coding Bootcamp Project Portfolio`

---

## 2. Main Sections (`##` H2)
* **Purpose:** To break down the README into major logical sections.
* **Examples:**
    * `## Project Overview`
    * `## Setup Instructions`
    * `## Project Structure`
    * `## Learning Journey & Progress`
    * `## Key Technologies Used`
    * `## Contact / Attribution`

---

## 3. Subsections Within Main Sections (`###` H3)
* **Purpose:** To provide further detail within a main section without creating a new top-level section.
* **Examples:**
    * (Under "Setup Instructions"): `### Prerequisites`
    * (Under "Setup Instructions"): `### Installation`
    * (Under "Project Structure"): `### Folder Layout`

---

## 4. Individual Assignment/Challenge Summaries (`####` H4)
* **Purpose:** To serve as a concise title for each distinct assignment or challenge overview.
* **Format:** `[README Sequential Number]. [Lesson Title] (Step [Actual Course Step Number])`
* **Example:** `#### 1. NOTEPAD++ ASSIGNMENT - Basic HTML Setup (Step 1)`
* **Example (for a later entry):** `#### 30. TABLE ASSIGNMENT (Step 188)`

---

## 5. Horizontal Rule (`---`)
* **Purpose:** Optional, can be used to visually separate very distinct major sections for strong visual breaks.
* **Placement:** Typically after a `##` heading, but used sparingly for major divisions. Do NOT use after every `####` entry.
