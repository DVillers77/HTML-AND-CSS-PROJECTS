# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS

Store coding projects from HTML and CSS Course for DVillers77







1st project is to create a simple html5 doc in English with tiltle and body elements. I gave it the title "Hello world".



2nd project is to create basic template for all HTML web pages titled “Assignment.html”.



3rd project is to create a basic webpage. Recreated the BASIC WEBPAGE ASSIGNMENT webpage in HTML only formatting. I used Google to learn how to change the spacing, add bullets and make a developer content note, "<!--Vertical spacing achieved with multiple <br> tags due to current parameters of HTML-only at this point in the course.-->". I gave it the title BASIC\_WEBPAGE\_ASSIGNMENT.
