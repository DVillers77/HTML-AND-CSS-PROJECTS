## 3. Course Subsections (`###` H3)

* **Example:** `### SUBSECTION E: LISTS AND TABLES WITH HTML AND CSS`

---

## 4. Individual Assignment Entries (`####` H4)
* **Purpose:** To serve as the primary title for each distinct assignment.
* **Format:** Includes the Course Step Number directly in the title.
* **Blank Lines:** Must be followed by a single blank line.

## 5. Sections Within an Assignment Entry (`###` H3)
* **Purpose:** To categorize fixed content fields within an individual assignment's entry.
* **Format:** Follows the `### [Section Name]:` format.
* **Blank Lines:**
    * The first `###` section (e.g., `### Date Completed:`) should be preceded by a single blank line after the `####` title.
    * All subsequent `###` sections (e.g., `### Objective:`, `### Core Course Concepts:`) must also be preceded by a **single blank line**.
* **Note:** The redundant "Course Step Number" line is omitted as it's part of the main `####` title.
