* **Outcome:** Explored W3Schools and Stack Overflow to understand their layout and utility as essential tools for coding assistance and debugging.
* **Relevant Files:** N/A (Exploration task)

#### 3. GitHub Repository Setup

* **Objective:** Establish a GitHub repository for course projects and configure local cloning.
* **Outcome:** Created `HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS` repository on GitHub, initialized with a README, and successfully cloned it locally using GitHub Desktop, establishing the central location for all course work.
* **Relevant Files:** N/A (Setup task - affects entire repo)

#### 4. Public GitHub Submission

* **Objective:** Ensure repository visibility is public for course submission.
* **Outcome:** Verified and adjusted repository settings to public visibility, preparing for assignment submission.
* **Relevant Files:** N/A (Configuration task)

#### 5. Notepad++ Setup & First HTML Page

* **Objective:** Install Notepad++ (or equivalent) and create/run a basic "Hello, world!" HTML page.
* **Core Course Concepts:**
    * Writing `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
    * Basic `<html>` structure with `lang="en"`.
    * Using the `<title>` element for page title.
    * Creating a paragraph with the `<p>` element.
    * Saving files with `.html` extension for browser execution.
    * Opening HTML files in Google Chrome.
* **Outcome:** Successfully configured a Notepad++ for HTML development and created a functional "Hello, world!" HTML page, confirming the workflow for saving and running code in a browser.
* **Relevant Files:** [hello_world.html](https://github.com/DVillers77/HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS/blob/main/Hello_world.html)

#### 6. File Extension Visibility

* **Objective:** Configure operating system settings to display file extensions.
* **Outcome:** Enabled file name extensions visibility in the OS, preventing common issues with incorrect file saving and ensuring proper code execution.
* **Relevant Files:** N/A (System configuration task)

### Section 2: Building Basic Webpages

#### 7. HTML Template Creation

* **Objective:** Create a reusable HTML template for future assignments.
* **Core Course Concepts:**
    * Reinforcement of basic HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, `<meta charset>`).
    * Understanding the importance of a consistent template for new HTML files.
* **Outcome:** Created `Assignment.html` with a standard HTML template, ready for content addition in subsequent assignments.
* **Relevant Files:** [Assignment.html](https://github.com/DVillers77/HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS/blob/main/Assignment.html)

#### 8. Basic Webpage Assignment

* **Objective:** Develop a basic HTML webpage incorporating specific structural elements.
* **Core Course Concepts**: The foundational understanding of **Document Structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`)**, **Headings (`<h1>`, `<h3>`, `<h6>`)**, and **Paragraphs (`<p>`)** was acquired directly through course materials and exercises. This included mastering their proper placement and hierarchical use to structure webpage content semantically.
    * **`<head>` Element**: Used to contain metadata about the HTML document, such as the page's title and character encoding.
        * **`<title>` Element**: Set the browser tab/window title for the page (e.g., "BASIC WEBPAGE ASSIGNMENT").
        * **`<meta charset="utf-8">`**: Declared the character encoding to ensure proper display of various characters.
    * **`<body>` Element**: Encapsulated all the visible content of the webpage.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices**: To enhance the assignment and understand more nuanced HTML behaviors, I conducted independent research, specifically focusing on:
    * **Lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`)**: Explored the use of an **unordered list (`<ul>`)** to semantically group related items (such as the required HTML tags for the assignment). Each item within the list was properly defined using an **`<li>` (list item) tag**, understanding that this provides a structured and accessible way to present bulleted information.
    * **HTML Entities (Escape Characters)**: Explored how to use `&lt;` and `&gt;` to accurately display literal HTML tag syntax (e.g., `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.) on the webpage, ensuring the browser renders them as text rather than interpreting them as active code.
    * **Controlling Visual Spacing in HTML-Only Environments**: Investigated methods for adding vertical space between elements without CSS. This led to the intentional use of multiple `<br>` tags (`<br><br>`) for visual separation between list items. This research included understanding that while effective for immediate visual spacing, this method is generally superseded by CSS for best practices in production environments.
    * **HTML Comments (``) for Developer Notes**: Researched the standard and best practices for incorporating developer-facing notes directly into the HTML source code. This included learning the precise syntax (``) and optimal placement (e.g., within `<head>` for overall document notes, or preceding specific code blocks) to ensure comments are invisible to the user but provide valuable context and documentation for code maintainability. This also involved understanding the distinction between HTML comments and metadata tags.
* **Project Outcome & Learning:** The assignment was successfully completed, demonstrating a solid grasp of fundamental HTML5 elements and their structural application. The independent research significantly deepened my understanding of practical HTML challenges and the importance of choosing appropriate techniques, even when adhering to specific constraints like an HTML-only environment.
