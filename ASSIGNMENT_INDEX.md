#### Step 71: IMAGE ASSIGNMENT - Practice File Paths
* **Objective:** Create a temporary website structure with an `Images` folder and an HTML file that links to a local image, focusing on practical experience with file paths.
* **Status:** Completed (Temporary Exercise).
* **Core Course Concepts:** File system organization, relative file paths, `<img>` tag, temporary project setup.
* **Relevant Files:** This assignment involved a temporary project structure (`Website/` folder on desktop), which was later deleted. Example files would include: `Website/my-image-page.html`, `Website/Images/my-image.jpg`. These files were not integrated into the main repository.
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This step provided hands-on experience with managing local file paths, which is crucial for linking assets like images within a project. An initial attempt to use a local placeholder image within the repository's main structure faced challenges due to link issues. As a solution/demonstration for linking images, a random cycling image from Picsum was subsequently used in a separate, temporary context to verify `<img>` tag functionality and external linking. The temporary "Website" folder was later deleted as instructed by the course.

* **Objective:** Create an HTML file that uses JavaScript to display an alert box.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html)

#### Step 109: SOURCE ATTRIBUTE ASSIGNMENT - Link External JavaScript
* **Objective:** Create an external JavaScript file (`basic-javascript-1.js`) containing the alert method, and then link it to `basic-html-1.html` using the script `src` attribute to enable external script integration.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html) (Modified)
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-javascript-1.js](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-javascript-1.js) (New)

#### Step 120: CREATING A FUNCTION (Independent Exercise)
* **Objective:** Implement a basic JavaScript function triggered by an HTML button click to dynamically update content using `document.getElementById()` and `innerHTML`.
* **Core Course Concepts:**
    * Basic JavaScript function definition.
    * HTML `onclick` event handler for user interaction.
    * Accessing HTML elements using `document.getElementById()`.
    * Manipulating element content with `innerHTML`.
* **Relevant Files:** [javascript-examples/120-onclick-function.html](javascript-examples/120-onclick-function.html)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** Identified and corrected a syntax issue in the course's example where the `innerHTML` assignment was inadvertently split across two lines, preventing the dynamic content update. The correction involved adding the assignment operator (`=`) to ensure the `result` was correctly applied to the `innerHTML` property.

#### Step 121: TWO PART ASSIGNMENT - HTML and JavaScript Separation
* **Objective:**
    1. Create a new HTML file (`basic-html-2.html`) initially containing the interactive function from the previous step.
    2. Separate the JavaScript function into the existing external `basic-javascript-1.js` file and link `basic-html-2.html` to it.
* **Core Course Concepts:**
    * Reinforcement of `document.getElementById()` and `onclick` event handling.
    * **Best Practice:** Separating HTML (structure) and JavaScript (behavior) into distinct files.
    * HTML `<script src="...">` tag for linking external JavaScript files.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-2.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-2.html)
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-javascript-1.js](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-javascript-1.js)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This step emphasizes the importance of code organization and modularity. It demonstrates how to add new JavaScript functionality to an existing shared `.js` file, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable web projects. Adhered to kebab-case for file and folder naming for consistency and best practice. The existing `basic-javascript-1.js` was also updated to explicitly say "Hello, World!" as per Step 106's instruction.

### Subsection C: THE DOM AND DEVELOPER TOOLS

#### Step 128: CHALLENGE - DevTools Familiarization
* **Objective:** Become familiar with Google Chrome's Developer Tools by performing foundational inspection and navigation tasks.
* **Core Course Concepts:**
    * Introduction to client-side web development tools.
    * Understanding the browser's role in rendering HTML.
    * Basic navigation within the DevTools interface.
* **Outcome:** Successfully navigated Chrome Developer Tools to inspect a live webpage's HTML structure (DOM), gaining foundational familiarity with this essential development environment.
* **Relevant Files:** Any existing HTML file (e.g., [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-2.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-2.html)) can be used.
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This challenge provided hands-on experience with DevTools, which are crucial for debugging and understanding how browsers interpret web code. Learning to inspect the live DOM is a foundational skill for future JavaScript interactions.

#### Step 133: WEB BROWSER TOOLS VIDEO - Cache & DevTools Essentials (Participation Activity)
* **Objective:** Understand browser caching, learn how to clear the cache, and gain further practical familiarity with essential Google Chrome Developer Tools panels.
* **Core Course Concepts:**
    * Browser caching mechanism and its impact on development.
    * Methods for clearing browser cache (full and force refresh).
    * In-depth practical use of Chrome DevTools: Elements panel (inspecting DOM, live editing), Console panel (REPL, error messages), Sources, Network, and an overview of other advanced panels.
* **Outcome:** Acquired the ability to manage browser cache effectively and utilize fundamental DevTools functionalities for inspecting, debugging, and temporarily modifying web pages during development.
* **Relevant Files:** Any local HTML file (e.g., [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-2.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-2.html)) was used for practical application and demonstration of DevTools.
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** Browser caching can be a significant hurdle during development, and mastering cache clearing methods like hard refresh is crucial. DevTools are the cornerstone of front-end debugging, allowing live inspection and testing. The ability to make temporary live edits in the Elements panel is particularly powerful for rapid prototyping and style adjustments.

#### Step 134: WEB BROWSER TOOLS ASSIGNMENT - Website Inspection

    * Using DevTools to make temporary, live modifications to webpage content (e.g., text, element visibility).
* **Outcome:** Gained hands-on experience in using browser Developer Tools to analyze the underlying code of any given website, enhancing understanding of web page construction and live debugging capabilities. Successfully inspected elements, understood nesting, and performed temporary content edits.
* **Relevant Files:** This assignment involved inspecting a live website (e.g., pff.com) using browser Developer Tools; no local project files were created or modified.
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** Directly inspecting live websites with DevTools is an invaluable skill for debugging, learning from existing sites, and rapid prototyping. It's fascinating to see how complex websites are structured and how quickly temporary changes can be made to test ideas, even if those changes aren't permanent. Recognizing dynamic content on complex sites (like the previous issue on The Tech Academy's page) versus simpler static elements is also a key practical insight gained.

## Section 4: WRITING CODE IN HTML

---

### Subsection A: STYLING WITH HTML

#### Step 144: COLOR ASSIGNMENT - Font Color with Deprecated Tags
* **Objective:** Add two paragraphs of text with specified colors to `basic-html-1.html` using the `<font>` element and its `color` attribute, demonstrating color names and hex codes.
* **Core Course Concepts:** Introduction to the `<font>` HTML element, specifying colors using color names and hexadecimal codes.
* **Outcome:** Successfully created/amended `basic-html-1.html` with correct HTML5 boilerplate, two colored paragraphs as instructed, and confirmed changes in the browser.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This assignment introduced the `<font>` HTML element for styling. While it fulfills the course requirement, it's critical to note that the `<font>` element is **deprecated in modern HTML5**. Its use is discouraged in favor of CSS for separating content from presentation. This step also highlighted the importance of a complete HTML5 boilerplate, as the initial file structure was based on an incomplete course example and required significant additions for proper best-practice setup.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices:**
    * The **initial `basic-html-1.html` file was amended to include standard HTML5 boilerplate elements**, which were missing from the course's example image. This included correcting `<!DOCTYPE HTML>` to `<!DOCTYPE html>`, adding `<meta charset="utf-8">` for proper character encoding, and including a `<title>` tag for browser tab display.
    * The **deprecated `<font>` tag** was used as per course instruction. The modern and preferred method for applying font colors is via **CSS**, using properties like `color` applied through `style` attributes (inline CSS), or more robustly, via internal or external stylesheets.
    * Through collaborative "independent research," the **best practice for `<script>` tag placement** was identified and implemented. Scripts are typically placed just before the closing `</body>` tag to ensure HTML content loads quickly and is available for JavaScript manipulation without render-blocking.
    * **Evolution of In-Code Comments:** Due to a unique display issue where standard HTML comments (``) were not visible in the chat interface, and a subsequent attempt with custom `<x-doc>` tags resulted in unwanted display on the live page, a more robust solution was implemented. **`<script type="text/plain">` tags are now used for in-code developer notes.** This method ensures the comments are visible in the code editor/source code but are explicitly ignored and not displayed on the live web page by the browser, making it a reliable and universally recognized approach for this specific purpose in HTML.

#### Step 146: FACE AND SIZE ASSIGNMENT - Font Customization with Deprecated Tags
* **Objective:** Open `basic-html-1.html` and add `face` and `size` attributes to a `<font>` element, utilizing three different font sizes (e.g., 2, 4, and 6) to customize the text appearance.
* **Core Course Concepts:** Introduction to the `<font>` HTML element, specifying font family with the `face` attribute, and setting font size with the `size` attribute (using numeric values 1-7).
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html) (Modified)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This assignment reinforced the use of deprecated HTML attributes for styling. It served as an important educational step to understand historical web development practices.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices:**
    * Through collaborative discussion, it was confirmed that the `<font>` tag is indeed **deprecated in HTML5**.
    * The modern and preferred approach for all font styling (color, family, size) is to utilize **CSS** properties (e.g., `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`). This adherence to CSS promotes a clear **separation of concerns** (structure in HTML, presentation in CSS), significantly improves maintainability, and aligns with current industry standards. This deeper understanding reinforces the importance of moving beyond older HTML styling methods.

#### Step 148: BOLD, ITALICS, UNDERLINE ASSIGNMENT - Text Styling with Deprecated Tags
* **Objective:** Open `basic-html-1.html` and add content that utilizes the `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` tags to display bold, italicized, and underlined text.
* **Core Course Concepts:** Introduction to the `<b>` (bold), `<i>` (italic), and `<u>` (underline) HTML elements for basic text styling.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html) (Modified)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This assignment provided hands-on experience with the `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` HTML elements for basic text styling, reinforcing understanding of direct inline formatting in HTML.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices:**
    * While the `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>` tags are still valid in HTML5, it's crucial to understand their role as primarily **presentational elements**. They convey visual style rather than semantic meaning.
    * For conveying **semantic meaning** (e.g., indicating importance or emphasis), the `<strong>` and `<em>` tags are the preferred modern alternatives. These tags have inherent meaning beyond just their default visual display.
    * For purely **visual styling** without semantic intent (e.g., a bold word just for aesthetic emphasis in a heading), **CSS** is the best practice. Properties like `font-weight: bold;`, `font-style: italic;`, and `text-decoration: underline;` offer greater control, promote separation of concerns, and improve maintainability of the codebase.

#### Step 149: IMAGE ELEMENT CHALLENGE - Image Element with Alt Attribute
* **Objective:** Define and learn how to utilize the HTML `alt` attribute by adding an `<img>` element to `basic-html-1.html` and demonstrating the `alt` text display when the image cannot be loaded.
* **Core Course Concepts:** Introduction to the `<img>` HTML element, specifying image source with the `src` attribute, and providing alternative text with the `alt` attribute.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html) (Modified)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This challenge provided hands-on experience adding an `<img>` element and directly observing the `alt` attribute's function as a fallback when the image source (`src`) is invalid or fails to load. This reinforced its practical utility in handling image display errors.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices:**
    * The `alt` attribute is **critical for web accessibility**, enabling screen readers to describe image content to visually impaired users. This ensures the information conveyed by images is accessible to all.
    * It also plays a significant role in **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**, as search engines use `alt` text to understand image content, which can improve image and overall page ranking.
    * **Best practice for `alt` text** is to be descriptive, concise, and convey the image's content and function, rather than just stating "image of...". This provides valuable context even when the image isn't visible.

#### Step 150: BASIC HTML AND JAVASCRIPT 1 SUBMISSION ASSIGNMENT
* **Objective:** Successfully push the `Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1` folder to the GitHub repository, ensuring all specified minimum requirements for HTML elements (`<img>`, `alt`, `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`) are met in `basic-html-1.html` for instructor review.
* **Core Course Concepts:** Consolidating basic HTML elements, adherence to project requirements, GitHub repository management, and submission procedures.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/](basic-html-and-javascript-1/) (Entire folder for submission)
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-html-1.html)
    * [basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-javascript-1.js](basic-html-and-javascript-1/basic-javascript-1.js)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This assignment marked a significant milestone, requiring the consolidation of all prior `Basic_HTML_and_JavaScript_1` work and preparing the project for formal instructor review. It was a useful exercise in ensuring all required elements were in place for a complete submission.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices:**
    * **Interpreting Submission Requirements:** This step highlighted the importance of carefully interpreting assignment submission instructions, especially when phrasing might be ambiguous (e.g., whether a specific file URL or a broader project folder URL is required). The decision to provide the **folder URL** was made for comprehensiveness, allowing instructors to access all relevant project files.
    * **GitHub Project Structure for Submissions:** Emphasized the best practice of pushing and linking to the entire project folder on GitHub. This ensures the integrity of the project's file structure and provides the reviewer with full context, including all associated files like HTML and JavaScript, for a holistic review.
    * **Pre-Submission Checklist:** This step served as a practical demonstration of performing a final self-review of code against minimum requirements, ensuring all criteria are met before formal submission.

#### Step 158: BASIC HTML AND CSS ASSIGNMENT
* **Objective:** Create a new folder (`basic-html-and-css`) and an HTML file (`basic-html-3.html`) to demonstrate `div` and `<style>` tag usage with font colors.
* **Core Course Concepts:** Basic HTML structure, internal CSS (`<style>` tag), CSS specificity, HTML `div` element, and file/folder organization.
* **Relevant Files:**
    * [basic-html-and-css/](basic-html-and-css/) (Entire assignment folder for review)
    * [basic-html-and-css/basic-html-3.html](basic-html-and-css/basic-html-3.html)
* **Reflection/Learning Note:** This assignment provided practical experience in setting up a small web project, integrating basic HTML elements with internal CSS, and observing CSS specificity in action. It reinforced the importance of file naming conventions.
* **Independent Research & Best Practices:**
    * **Kebab-Case File Naming:** Confirmed kebab-case as a best practice for web-related file and folder names (`basic-html-and-css`, `basic-html-3.html`) for better URL compatibility and readability.
    * **Internal vs. External CSS:** Reaffirmed that while internal CSS is suitable for small, single-page examples, external stylesheets are generally preferred for larger projects for better organization and maintainability.
